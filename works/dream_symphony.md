What happens when composers fall asleep? They conduct Dream Symphonies.
In this dreamlike adventure game, you need to make the most of your trampoline prowess. Bounce off the back
of sheep to hit perfect pitch…and collect musical notes along your journey. Get a boost from the floating bubbles,
but beware of dangerous red bubbles, which can wake you up. Perfect your aim, because
there’s no way back down: the only way is up.
