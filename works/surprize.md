Popular and high-loaded application for the biggest social network in the former USSR - VKontakte.

This is amazing app where users could send each other gifts which could be open only in a certain day.
In the most loaded days, it was on the 3rd place by popularity in entire network, with 1.3 million unique daily users.
And the first place by growth rate.
