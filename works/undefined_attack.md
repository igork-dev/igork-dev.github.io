Other name: Save Ukraine

Unidentified horde of armed men suddenly attacked a cozy house. The inhabitants were not ready for such events and the
only weapon to defend their homeland they had was just a crop of old pumpkins. Nevertheless, a good and precise hit of
such “shell” can neutralize few of those soldiers or even an armored truck.
