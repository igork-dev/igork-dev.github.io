A little bear named Bobby has a dream. He wants to cook a fruit soup. Help the little bear to have a bite and to
collect all ingredients for the fruit soup. Use the elements of the environment to achieve your goal. Be careful
and do not eat the chilli peppers â€“ they are very hot. Watch the fruits attentively, otherwise they can be eaten
by hungry pigs. Collect the stars to earn more points. Good luck!
